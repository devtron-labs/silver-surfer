**Silver Surfer** is [Apache 2.0 licensed](LICENSE) and accepts contributions via GitHub

it easier to get your contribution accepted.

We gratefully welcome improvements to issues and documentation as well as to code.

## Certificate of Origin

By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a
simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the
contribution. No action from you is required, but it's a good idea to see the
[DCO](DCO) file for details before you start contributing code to Devtron.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to silver-surfer](https://github.com/devtron-labs/silver-surfer/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)).
We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below).

Always write a clear messages for your commits. 


## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

* Please always format the code before you create a pull request. Know more about [go fmt tool](https://go.dev/blog/gofmt)
* Please include test cases covering all the base & corner cases.
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love drifting when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
* Please update the documentation in case of new feature or enhancement.
